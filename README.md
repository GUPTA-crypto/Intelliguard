This ia an AI-powered Threat Intelligence model aimed at assisting organizations in promptly 
detecting and precisely identifying cyber threats, thereby augmenting cybersecurity measures and facilitating proactive 
threat mitigation. 
This solution utilizes advanced techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and logistic regression to effectively 
match input strings to specific threat types. Along with this, python was also used to ensure that this model can run on 
linux machines.
